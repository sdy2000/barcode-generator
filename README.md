## Description

The "barcode-generator" project is a web application that allows users to generate various types of barcodes and QR codes. It is developed using C#, .NET, and it utilizes the BarcodeLib and QRCoder libraries for barcode and QR code generation. The application provides a user-friendly interface for users to input their data and download the corresponding barcode images.

## Technologies Used

The project utilizes the following technologies:

- C#: The primary programming language used for the backend development.
- .NET: The framework used to build the application.
- **Bootstrap**: These are my go-to CSS frameworks for quickly styling and prototyping web applications.
- BarcodeLib: A C# library used for generating different types of barcodes (e.g., Code 39, Code 128, etc.).
- QRCoder: A C# library used for generating QR codes.
